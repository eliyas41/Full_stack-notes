JavaScript Objects
Real Life Objects
In real life, objects are things like: houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.

Object Properties
    A real life car has properties like weight and color:

    car.name = Fiat, car.model = 500, car.weight = 850kg, car.color = white.

    Car objects have the same properties, but the values differ from car to car.

Object Methods
    A real life car has methods like start and stop:

    car.start(), car.drive(), car.brake(), car.stop().

    Car objects have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

JavaScript Variables
    JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

JavaScript Objects
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

    This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to an object named car:
    const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

JavaScript Object Definition
  How to Define a JavaScript Object
    Using an Object Literal
    Using the new Keyword
    Using an Object Constructor

JavaScript Object Literal
    An object literal is a list of name:value pairs inside curly braces {}.

    {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}

        const person = {
          firstName: "John",
          lastName : "Doe",
          id       : 5566,
          fullName : function() {
            return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
          }
        };

        In the example above, this refers to the person object:
        this.firstName means the firstName property of person.
        this.lastName means the lastName property of person.

Array-
An array is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, numbers
example 
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"];
const mixed = [1, "apple", 3, "banana", 5, "cherries"];

const arr = [];
const obj = {};
